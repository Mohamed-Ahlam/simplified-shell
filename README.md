The goal of this project is making a simplified command-line shell called swish (aka Simple Working Implementation Shell). This shell will be less functional in many ways from standard shells like bash (the default on most Linux machines), but will still have some useful features. This project uses system calls, specifically, system calls for process creation, process management, I/O, and signal handling to build a swish.

Whenever you use a terminal program, you interact with a shell process. Command-line shells allow one access to the capabilities of a computer using simple, interactive means. Type the name of a program and the shell will bring it to life as a new process, run it, and show output. Familiarizing yourself with the inner workings of shells will give you a chance to appreciate how system calls can be usefully combined and will make you a more effective command-line user.
